Solution: Unit Tests

There are many ways that the code could be fixed in order to pass the provided unit tests. One solution to the exercise can be found in the compute_launch_answers.py file in the workspace, and is shown below:

def days_until_launch(current_day, launch_day):
    """"Returns the days left before launch.
    
    current_day (int) - current day in integer
    launch_day (int) - launch day in integer
    """
    if (launch_day - current_day < 0):
        return 0
    return launch_day - current_day
